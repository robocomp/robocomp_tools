## What the `rcdeplymentchecker` does?

The `rcdeplymentchecker` is a tool for checking the deployment files used by rcmanager. This tool parse the xml file for the config files of the components in the local machine or the given path and show a list of configured components interfaces and it ports or a list of ports and the associated interfaces.
This tool can also be used to check if a particular port is available or used in any config file.
It's not uncommon to have different instances of the same component running in different ports, but one port can only be used by one interface at the same execution time. This tool help the Robocomp developer to find available ports and also to find some possible conflicts when executing several components at the same time.

## How can we execute the `rcdeplymentchecker` tool?

Executing the `rcdeplymentchecker` without parameters or the `-h` option the full command help is shown:
```shell
rcdeplymentchecker -h
```
```console
usage: rcdeplymentchecker [-h] [-v] [-p PORT] [-a] [-l]
                        {ports,interfaces} [path]

Application to look for existing configured interfaces ports on components

positional arguments:
  {ports,interfaces}    Show the interfaces by name or by port
  path                  path to look for components config files recursively
                        (default="~/robocomp/")

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         increase output verbosity
  -p PORT, --port PORT  List only the selected port information
  -a, --all             show all ports configured for an interface instead of
                        showing only those with more than one interface per
                        port
  -l, --lower           show all ports with numbers lower than 10000
```
## Command examples
- List the ports used by more than one interface
```
        ./rcdeplymentchecker ports
```
- List all the ports with one or more interfaces configured tu run on that port:
```
        ./rcdeplymentchecker -a ports
```
- List all the ports with one or more interfaces configured on it and with a number under 10000 (de facto standard is using ports above 10000):
```
        ./rcdeplymentchecker -a -l ports
```
- List interfaces configured at the 11003 port if any:
```
        ./rcdeplymentchecker -p 11003 ports
```
- List interfaces by name showing the ports used and the path to the config files where it can be found:
```
        ./rcdeplymentchecker comps
```
## TODO
This tools is currently under development and can contain bugs and some information may be missing from the output.
- The content of files/components-port.txt could be used to check if the ports used ar the default or not.
- Implement a new mode to give the next available port (maybe it could find gaps)
- Create a better hierarchy of arguments with subcommands and parameter groups: https://chase-seibert.github.io/blog/2014/03/21/python-multilevel-argparse.html
- Search/filter by interface name
